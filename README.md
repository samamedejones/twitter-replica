# Drinks Menu
![frutas](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edad9b46-d7c3-4ff6-afe1-2fd5bba1a2ee)


In this project I created a very colorful drinks menu with transition animations between one drink and another.

## Learnings

Here I learned extra CSS techniques, such as creating animations with keyframes and also in the javascript part I had to have logical thinking so that I could move between the menu options without breaking the code
